This is the end day of the week and I don't know what to write next. 

I may misunderstood between having high EQ and being emotionally intense. There's not so many correlations between two those areas. But being emotionally intense can lead to high EQ, however, that's a small chance. 

It brings me some benefit, also some adversity when having relationships (friendship). I started to realize some of my weekness in a clearer way rather than misunderstanding it. Around being less dramatic and highly sensitive, being able to resolve my own uncontrolling behaviors. It makes quite a good sense in how things flow right now. 

Having destroyed some relationships make me less suffered, alone will solve all the problems Im having. A crazy man who's trying to isolate himself from people, but merely with a good purpose. I really don't want to harm other people, reduce their time by my numb feeling. A feeling of transforming starts exploding in me. A better day, better way of meeting people seems possible to come. 

In the end, let things do its course. I can sense that Im swimming against the river, but I'm happy that I don't have to do it more this time onwards.
