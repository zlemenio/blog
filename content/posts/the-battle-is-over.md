How's the feeling when you keep insisting on things that seem impossible to achieve? That's how I feel currently. There's a show near my house which plays the music quite loud from mid of the day until late at night. It makes me frustrated since I can't focus on learning. Conversely, I keep sitting at the table with the hope that I will concentrate more on absorbing the knowledge, when my headphones don't have the block noise function.

How interesting it is. 

Than I seek out the morning period, that's one of the most wise things I have done to handle this situation. There's a strange noise from various chickens, and the voice of a monk from nowhere but I barely can here it. With the exception of the one (chicken) near my house, I can incorporate all those small "challenges". 

In fact, there are some obstacles to be an "early bird" - for one day. It's the laziness when having to leave the warmth of your bed, and the staying up late habit that makes me feel hesitate. But for none of the above reasons, I'm not feeling right when having to leave the work I haven't done with a more promising day that could meet the same problems. That's perfectionism in someway. 

Nevertheless, I feel better when writing in the morning. My mood is quite still when I haven't been through any conversation, which will incredibely boost up the quality of this post, thus I have more time to reorganize my thoughts. 

Chiefly, the overall post I sent was the product of my free writing process. I have to come over to the step of ordering and reflecting for paragraph. It could be in the grammer and the way I convey ideas. There will perhaps, be some positivity in the morning instead of the exhausted feeling I have at the end of the day. 

This is the way to crack the code.
