I'm still in the process of facing the results of what I did previously. I know. It seems a long time when everyday, keep exposing to it isn't the good thing att all.

But we think more carefully about the time or duration can really take us to pass that "test", that doesn't take that long. I'm just looking up my life as it consits with only that specific event. 

There's a song which match exactly with the title of this post tells the whole story. It quite old but worth listening if you want. Briefly, the lyrics would tell about what troubles you might facing them right now isn't major. In the long run, you might encounter with something else. 

I know, it might be the way. "I'm the key so you can't close the door". Giving all your effort and promising thing could happen in an unknown day. Enjoy your first day of the week.

Peace,
Lemenio
