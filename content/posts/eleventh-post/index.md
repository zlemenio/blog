Is it neccessary to know whether you're an extravert or introvert?
<!--more-->
Yes. Sometimes.

But that isn't the case when you already understood deeply yourself. Know what you need, that's enough. 

To me, I'm still doubting myself between those two personalities. Since me have both of its traits, it's hard to have a right definition for people in these perspectives. It's varied.

Complex and all relative. 

This also an interesting topic to be mentioned. If you can define which type of personalites suit you the most, that's great. You can also search for your counter-one, they're doing great in supporting your personalites and vice versa.
