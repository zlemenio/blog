Sometimes things go beyond our control. It's just not that easy to keep a positive mindset during this period. Clueless and even a way to strive through, need more motivation. 
<!--more-->

I know myself as an idealistic person. Usually makes things even more complex than what it's truly is. Sometimes I wasn't that strong enough to face straight away with problems, though it'll come soon. 

Like what someone has said, "sometimes it's just hard to move on" in my post's comments. From this perspective, only you can motivate yourself and find ways to get out of this zone as soon as possible. I believe. 

Not practical right? Try another solution. 

Allow yourself to spend some time for healing, accepting the truth or staying with the problems. Anything you want. But commit yourself a specific amount of time. Could be 15 minutes, 1 hour, a day ... 

After that, you have to wake up and get out of that tricky zone. You spend your whole life for experiences, not one.
