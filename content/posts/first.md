Having been thinking about making this stuff, I finally did it after a long time's digging around with Website and domains.

This time I'm back with more things, especially this journey. After a while, I've come up with some ideas to "make" a website so that it's easier for me to share ideas.Â 

The reason I chose this format instead of social media is that I'll have more control and ability to do things than on Facebook or Twitter. You'll have a choice whether to read my blogs or not. I'm not using a hook or anything else to make you stay on the page. Your visit, your choice. 

I'm here to feel more freedom and don't have the pressure to write "short" on social platforms. That means I can spend more time flexing more on a daily basis without worrying too much about the output. It's pretty much easy and more accessible, assuming people use browsers, so it'll be fine.

The final thing I want to imply here is that you guys also have the ability to comment on my post as well. Since this's still two-way communication, more interactive means more chances to turn strangers into connections. By the way, I'm new to writing and am really looking forward to you pointing out some grammar issues that I have or other related

That's it. In my first post, nothing much. As soon as the new "product" is released, stay tuned.
