Whenever you talk or speak, think carefully before expressing yourself. I used to believe that being authentic and truthful would be essential, but after some shocking events that taught me how to analysize and reflect my thoughts before showing them. Carefully saying things and avoid hurting people if possible, showing respect to them (a bit exaggeration here). 

Ask yourself first, make sure you're understanding the situation and aware of what you're doing. Then, freely showing them but under some limitations, it's an essential thing to do when limiting yourself. Come out of this zone might be easy for me, but it's patience and consistency that matters the most. 

Wake up in the morning, remind myself that logic should be another part that needs to be fully growth up. Institution sometimes doesn't work as well, carefully thinking is a crucial thing to do with me now. It is my problem now, not exactly that heavily but it's the thing I need to develop and push yourself to a better stage of being mindful about actions. 

Meditate is one of the most practical solutions, but didn't do it in a proper way took its toll on me (another exaggeration sorry). It doesn't seem to really work, so paying more attention to my health and timing. It will be a great choice to truthly receive the benefits of meditation. So appreciate my INTJ friend for making me realize these things, or at least taking a splash of water into my face that I should change.

Oh by the way, I shouldn't care much about those MBTI things since they're useless now. Each person is so special and different that those definitions might be too general to me. Keep reading those related articles only makes me forget who really I am. Too idealistic here. 

Hi new year, I'm now ready for a new change and improving period. Glad to see me at a better version. Hope you have a nice week full of energy and best of luck. Happy reading!
