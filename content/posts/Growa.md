Light it up.
<!--more-->

Not wishes for a better and easier life, challenges should make you grow harder. I pray for more hardships to shape my better version. The thing I'm scared that I haven't faced enough adversities to become more mature.

Come.

I'm ready for all the struggles feeling, stressful and gloomy moments. Even I'm down to my last breathe, I'll still fight for my own future. Idealistic, imagination, reserved, shall those things should make me feel more stress or otherwise I'll beat them.

Take.

Take all the thing you want from me, do it. Live will be suffered from times to time, avoiding it will only make things worse. Take a break, refresh and start facing it again. 

Do.

Now it's time to face it, act, and burn everything, go crazy if it's necessary. Show me possibilities, I'll explain to you why it matters. Show me challenges, I'll show how to tackle that problems. Show me incidents, see how I'll get through it. 

Go. 
Light it up, no matter how hard it takes. Your life, your own choice and your own future. Destiny, got it, they might right at some point but one decisions can make a million possibilities. Speed it up, make it and play hard. 

Cheers,
