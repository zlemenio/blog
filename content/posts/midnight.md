If you're happy or currently experience some possitive moment, than you should skip this post. Mostly, it's about me facing with myself and uncertainty I have with my own future.
<!--more-->

I know there was some clues in my journey, the process of learning and chasing goals do make sense to me. But I feel it's kinda weird experience, thinking I'm heading myself in the wrong direction or even worse thinking I'm always right.

I should face it, there's a possiblity that everything will fail. But, half road already done, I can't just sitting here hesitating and claimming that I can't do it or whatsoever, since time is nearly over. No matter effort I'm trying to convince myself I don't have much time left, the hesitating process still keeping up and stress me out. 

Just kidding. Me realized there was something wrong and I skipped through some important steps that essential for my road. Which make sense for the thing I'm doing doesn't occur any promising results. I mean it works but not that much as I expected. 

I realized that I shouldn't run away, it won't work. I gotta find something interesting inside my world just to inspire me back, and keep working. Though there might be some failures will happen, but I'm happy with it. 

Gratitude moment?

I'm bonding with a good friend, my social anxiety now has ceased a bit. I got better relationship with my family, I think more carefully before doing things. It is better now, I'm ready to move on. 

Now I haven't fully imagined what will happen next to me in the future but there probably will have some changes. I'm feeling that energy is flowing inside me, new lease on life? Could be. 

Stay tuned!
