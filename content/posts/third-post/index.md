Starting to realize when we keep moving on and leave behind the perfectness of the result, we have more time for other activities. Spend too many time and focus on the quality may exhaust our ability to solve other problems on the daily basis. 

As a person who deserves something suitable with my statisfaction. This quite hard to me. But time after times, spend time and prioritize your goals would be definitely crucial to our live. Trust me. 

Used to make writing as something boring and contains much of pressure. Leading to the feeling of denying to write any other post, but the I do enjoy the feeling when sharing things. That means, gotta be find when keep doing things at a medium amount to sharpen skills. Accept the imperfection. 

We wasn't born to be ...

Happiness deserves more than one thing. We can't just say it's our life which dedicated to some specific part of careers. But you can prioritize them over other things, it's totally fine. Life is a mixture of feelings that can't be charged with ony one of them. Living solely on one side nothing more than ruinning your life.

Moving on, doing things you want. At this moment maybe something else is more important but don't eliminate all the left. I might run out of ideas right now, but the thing I want to imply here is **don't dedicated your life to one thing**. 

Find your *perfect* filter.

Comes down to solving all the problems by prioritize them. You probably need to know which one is more important to you, which can't be replaced with something else. Stuck? Spend time alone and write down all the keywords you feel important to your life. Than spend more time reorder them and keep testing until you find the suitable order.

There was only person I wanted to find
It was the better you
