The more we want to live, the less we are willing to fight. For death. It's a great topic over there, lots of mature people advice young generations to think about that word several times. It does boost our life performance.

If you're on the verge of being shot by someone, you'll find all possible ways to run away from it. What I'm advocating for is the passion we should spend on that word, since after all, the only thing that stays with us is the lessons not all of this material. We're here to live, and learn.

Not for everyone. A day of enlightentment happens, don't try to please other people, please yourself first. Whenever you want to make things better, you can try to break it down or at least force yourself to face it instead of avoiding them. I feel myself better when being more rational but I'm not really into it. Though its own advantage of better solving problems, drives yourself crazy sometimes really is the most funny thing I could do. Vulnerability and crazyness are both the most powerful weapons to read people but don't take use of it for much.
