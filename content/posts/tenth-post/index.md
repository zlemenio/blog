It's hard when asking the question **How**?

When things get even more tough, we tend to avoid facing them. Start complaining about life. For both of us, it's the thing we usually do. 

That's totally fine. What our brains usually do is trying to lessen our effort when solving the problem. Avoiding them might be a good solution. But there's another one that does effectively solve them. 

Ask your self, **How**? 

For me, accept the reality takes some time but the next step doesn't take that long. To do so, repeat the statement that makes you feel fine. I mean having a practical view about the problems. Remember to do them slowly, take yourself some time. 

Ok then? 

If you can accept the fact that your issues is now in front of you and have to solve them. Start asking yourself frequently, you might get the answer. If you can make it into a habit, that'll enhance your problem solving skill. It's the essential one in the future. 

Enjoy your day.
