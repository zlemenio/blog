Having been through a next darkness moment. Feel like I was missing out on something essential in my personalities. Anger, anxiety, sad, happy, all that emotion happens through plenty of events. Am I lying? Maybe.

Just like a habit, I blame, what currently happens to me is because of external conditions. Straight fully damage to my mental health when holding that mindset for two days long. Weakness keeps me back in the comfort zone and I don't even confront with the problems.

That's a bit exaggeration.

What I learned today is "the problem isn't outside it's your mental health cause the problems". It isn't the way it is. It's how it's inside. When looking back at the whole attitude I made when interacting with people, I realized it's only consisted of angryness and taking advantage.

That's how I received the results.
