You want a happier life.

Trust me, something may be worth your time more than chatting about life on that small digital thing. If you use it for self-entertainment and releasing stress, try to replace it with something else, such as drawing and such.

It will release dopamine over time. The more you have, the less likely you are to spend time on personal development.

Don't dedicate yourself to that digital lifestyle, no matter how introverted you are. Still, it's beneficial to go out and meet people, not frequently but some for later uses.

It doesn't have to be friends; they could be acquaintances.

I bet no one will care much about this post, so I'll explain further.

There's a social media detox trend in these too-advancing times. I read some of their experiments and found quite a few decent responses after starting to give up Messenger's apps.

If I have the chance, I'll also delete that stupid thing and live a more real life. I would like to touch, see, and talk to real people rather than see them on a screen. I mean, we're humans; we still need real connections. Don't know how or why all the experiencing starts becoming virtual.

If the metaverse becomes a reality, I will suffer way more than usual. I don't know; there will be a lack of conditions when you're communicating through messaging. To speak face-to-face, allow me to see more from you; it could be facial expressions, your outfit, or eye movement. I read people through those things, of course, way faster than on chat.

People will have more time to think. A new persona may bloom.
