There's always light in the darkness. 

I always say "show them your empathy" as saying more than needed in every conversation. Including those people who are impatient when hearing. I was wrong.

It takes me a while until I hear the sentence from Seth Goldin "speak less impact more". With a lesser amount of words, you'll be able to speak more since more space was created. Your partner don't have to suffer to analysize what you are saying. 

It's so good. 

When less word were created, allow yourself to speak as simple as you could. As a result, you'll be able to articulate more efficiently. I believe.

What communication needs is how much you can transfer your ideas. Not how long the talks will take. People sometimes (including me) say without thinking, that's totally fine if you're being surrounded by people who understand you the most. That isn't the case for strangers. 

Organize your thoughts before spitting it out. 

Yes, people usually skip this step when discussing with **co-workers**. And most extroverts do so (yea yea, I'm an extrovert). It's crucial to do so since every person on the planet is different. In ability, characteristic and even mindset. *How can you talk to a bird without understanding their language?*

Acting more. 

When less space is created for talking, you can do. Without saying a words.
Action also speaks for themselves. That's less talk obviously. People won't pay attention when you're describing your plan. What they are interested in is your results. Not the process. 


Maintain. 

Sometimes, it's hard to stay all things under control. As I said earlier, there's some moments I speak to people without my brains along. Breaking a habit and building a new one, is not always easy as it is understood. Keep calm when there's some unexpected moment. We're humans, not robots.

Last thoughts. 

I wrote this paragraph in an early morning, fresh and my mental health also improved (I mean the mood). Wake up early if you can, worth it.
