Can't denying the fact that ordering play a vital role in our life. It saves our life in the aspect of dedication. Which dedicated to the thing we actually fall in love with. 
<!--more-->

At some point, this isn't the ideal thing. There's actually no one-size-fit-all, our mission is to find that smaller part and learn how to deal with it. Briefly, allow yourself to do thing without planning along. 

Sometimes, it needs us to do something in order to move on. Small step is fine, in the long run you'll see the "domino effect". What I'm trying to say is accept that you might fail, the more you f_ck around the more you find the solutions. 

Have fun and enjoy your day.
