Highly recommend you watch an anime and revisit this post.

It's Sunday, I haven't accomplished all my tasks but still here chilling with writing. I'll try my best to maintain the frequency of this blog, about once a week. That's another announcement I want to inform you of. 

Basically, I asked myself what's the point of my existence. It turned out to be easy, I lived here for nothing. Hold on, don't misunderstand my point. There's nothing called a reason for living or purposing, deep down inside, it is past experiences that form your mindset. How you feel, conception and all that stuff is already predetermined. 

But, what if you don't know why you're here? Doesn't matter, the intentional building of connections between your physical body and inmaterial mind has in fact, kept you away from death. It said, you should stay in this world and continue living, observing and doing what you like. However, it's crucial to recognize some rules in this life game. That's your two mission when living, at least to me. 

I don't believe our origin is the evolution of some strange animals like gorillas or something else. There's a contradiction in its conception here, most animals are merely physical but we suddenly get the ability to think logically. That's crazy.
