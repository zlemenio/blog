I have doubted myself for a long time, about the purpose of my writing. Is it for the readers or solely self entertainment? I write helplessly, for the sake of leisure.

Through writing, I can do various things including impact other people. Moreover, I feel good when doing this creative process. It isn't about the outcome, rather the hobby I have with it. Don't be silly. I am still conveying my message.

So does it matter to write for yourself or readers?

The answer is no. It depends on your purposes, and for what reason you're continuing writing. You might want to be a life coach but need some reputation? How about entering this literacy world? It's full of potential. You will need to learn a ton of things, thus learning more skills to gain such ability to make you become a respected author. 

Just kidding. The way it works is much simpler now due to the supportation of WordPress. It's a platform for no-code users. You can spend more time delve into that part, worth it. Mostly, you purely need to learn some more marketing skills to become a magnet. That is, able to attract more customers to your service (writing). 

You can now achieve everything you want. 

What are you waiting for? Go and get it.
