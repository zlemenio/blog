You own your life. 
<!--more-->

Forget about those predetermined thing, I am bored with it. Having walked around the numerlogy and astrology part to see what my future defines. Guess what? I always have the feeling of "prediciting the future", rather than taking responsibility for my own action. I don't say guidance is bad, it just don't suit well with this guy.

I suffered. 

I always have the feeling of anxious, regardless how fate is happening and keep slapping into my face and say "Hey! How the hell did you forget about my existence". I keep dreaming of impossible possibilities, that might sound insane at first but when you thoroughly think, it's meaningless. 

You know, it's your life, you have control over it. Don't let it pass into the hand of those hypnotiser. Your life's perspective will change drastically, no matter how hard your effort in conserving them. It was really freaking hard to get through and completely delete those data out of your mind. Trust me, worth it. 

You experience the failure, it will up a much stronger "you" rather than something are described on paper and conceptional theories. Some might fit you, some might not; it's you the only person will learn and responsible for all of your actions. I'm sick of seeing myself be fixed in a certain way, act and behave the same way the articulated. 

Free.
