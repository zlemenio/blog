There's a singer that sings [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaZ247exE0o) and you better listen to it.

Fun fact, he's Vietnamese but using English in his own performances. I haven't known the reason behind this, could be for easier access when using the most popular language. But when listening to his songs, you can pay attention to the meaning in his sentences.

He's such a person that doesn't deserve something colorful or bling bling, a guy with modest experiences. His lyrics also possesses some of the great idioms and phrasal verbs so you can take use of it for the sake of learning Engrish. I feel that it wasn't that catchy or trending videos, though the singer has to do so, I somehow see it less in this guy.

Nevertheless, I don't think I can survive tmr with this late night sleeping. But I still want to write down some of the feelings I got from a friend, it was an impression - a friend, about his knowledge. After having exhibited his ability, I indeed need to improve myself and such, for every moment, I should live with a warmer heart, and a cold head to make decisions.

Trust me, there's always a light at the end of the turned. The more efforts you put in, the most you'll receive. Even attempting in the darkness, still moving with a belief inside, worth it. I can't appreciate what's happening right now. 

That's enough for today. Hope you have a good start to the week since it's the first day of the week.

Oh wait, people are indeed gonna change. It's the inevitable thing, but when you want a people along, you'll need to learn how to truly appreciate the moment they're still there. Until they've changed, we'll slowly accept it, or perhaps go crazy. That's when we need to learn to both appreciate and accept. That's the lesson I got from the day before.
