I'm a young Vietnamese student who craves to know more about things. I have binded with Astrology and Numerology and Tarot, therefore I let my time passby and always think that my future is already written. My journey is to prove what has pointed out on those things are numb and only me will be the one who decides my owns. 

> Living, a better place to live. 

I don't think life is a blurry thing that always make you suffer, you haven't recognized your meaning, therefore, everything might become so dark afterwards. Peoplel reach out to many supportation but they haven't reached to themselves, forgetting about the inner force that make them grow. I have a belive about human that they possess a superpower that we haven't fully developed. 

In order to change, to move on easier, we have to take use of all the strengths. But first and foremost, we have to have a better understanding about yourself because it will be the nearest ally. No matter how hard the problems life throws at us, I believe we still can stay intact. Simply need a better knowledge about things, about yourself. 

> Insipration

My journey was inspired by the chairman of the club I joined. He's a brilliant guy who knows how to made use of his power to bring things to life. He taught me about thoughts and how they affect your life, I learned so much things from him. The efforts he made were also massive, I admire and want to become like that person. 

Everything takes time to grow, be mature and kind will be key for personal developments. That's what I'm aiming for in this blog post, broaden knowledge and share them to people. This blog will post most things I have learned along my road to enlightenment . 

Clearly, I aslo need to spare some small money to maintain this website so hope to get supports from you if I intend to shout out to "by me a cup of coffee". 

Hope ya have a good day!
