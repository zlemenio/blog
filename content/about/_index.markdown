Hi, I'm Vietnamese but frequently use English since it's more simple and pretty much fall in love with its format. I made this page up so that it's easier for me to share ideas and don't have that much pressure when using social media. Oh, how about a deeper insight about this person?

Well, there's three words that perfectly describe me: natural, idealistic, ordinarly. That's the final "nio" of Lemenio, part of the meaning of my name. 

### Content mostly about?
Philosophy and life lessons. Can be something else but mostly  

### Final thoughts?
There's a change people can change the world, in order to do so, they have to change themselve first. This is a blog to write down what he has been through.
