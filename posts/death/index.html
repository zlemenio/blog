Having endured with some depression and receive some supporation from friends, I have realized that there&rsquo;s three session to confront with it.</p><ol><li>Life gets blurry, people resort to death.</li></ol><p>I&rsquo;ve found some situations, mostly about their inability to handle situation and face the brutual reality in this futile life. Albeit, we were born with it inside. The brain system attempting to rapidly accomplish the dilemma. If you sink in it deeper, you&rsquo;ll be in. This when some sort of therapist session, digging deeper in depression would be vital.</p><p>On the other hand, we could see it as a first step to move on. Each of us has the program of assuming or accept some hard concept but takes time. When that requirement passed, you&rsquo;ll be transfered to a new level which will surge your potential.</p><ol start=2><li>Life gets tedious when it&rsquo;s infeasible to die.</li></ol><p>At this stage, they have no other choices than keep living and maintain their daily activities. It could be their family obstacles or studying period that need to be finished. Any sudden occurences would be truly appreciated. At this time onwards, you start caring for yourself in both physical and mentaly but in a careless way.</p><p>Life is meaningless - Nihilism now comes to the game due to some repetitive tasks, thus it can be very wearisome. Noetic, we don&rsquo;t even know the reason of our existence, barred from knowing &lsquo;why&rsquo;, even our experience, is uniquessness. Meaning people can sympathize part of the story, not fully extended one. Loneliness and isolated feeling start irrating you on a daily basis. Howbeit, you still need to continue living because of a particular pledge.</p><p>&ldquo;How about a cup of coffee outside?&rdquo;
-Yes.</p><ol start=3><li>At another period, life gets in the way meaning.</li></ol><p>Someone breathed you back to life. It is without any doubt that you&rsquo;re moving and not even hesitate to acheive more achievements.</p><blockquote><p>What doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger</p></blockquote><p>If death doesn&rsquo;t harness you, it&rsquo;s now necessary to help other people and inspire them who&rsquo;s stucking at first level of this &lsquo;mori&rsquo; game. We now have a brand new lease on life. Chasing goals, pursuing experiences that matter to you and all sort of beauty in this world start to be revealed. Like I used to said, it doesn&rsquo;t always seem to be that miracle and need more effort to shift yourself.</p><p>Nevertheless, whatever state you&rsquo;re in, I find it doesnt matter. The most and foremost thing you can do is start respecting and loving yourself, even with the depression you&rsquo;re facing with. Out there, many people are diagnosed with chronic grief so why feeling embrasshed about it?</p></div><div class=tags><a href=https://lemenio.me/tags/death>Death</a></div><div class=commentbox></div><script src=https://unpkg.com/commentbox.io/dist/commentBox.min.js></script>
