The amount of work I put in this blog wasn&rsquo;t enough so I decided to give this site a new look. The reason I chose orange was because it can represent the signal of blooming, moving forwards in the personal development in the most energetic vibe which also the thing I want to head myself to. The design, formatting is also a huge plus point when considering about the eye-catching realm.</p><p>If you have headed yourself into the home page than you might already saw some small icons at the bottom of the page. Some of it, might direct you to the right place but some don&rsquo;t do that exact thing. It is because I&rsquo;m still on the way developing some extra social media platforms, take some time to build it up from scratch so I&rsquo;ll keep updating it as soon as I can.</p><h2 id=to-expect-what>To expect what</h2><p>In order to maintain the content&rsquo;s qualities, I&rsquo;ll try to release the post once every three weeks. Sometimes, the process could take longer than usual due to my studying exams so please keep that in mind. In the near future, this site will be developed into the all-in-one place for my personal life notetaking and also updating about things. If you want to follow me in the long term than please bookmark this site.</p><p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t have a clear plan how this site should go since I&rsquo;m still learning. But one thing I could firmly state with you is that I&rsquo;ll dedicate all of my effort onto how to make this site look more professional and elegant later on. But first and foremost, we will look at this layout for quite a long time until I can make more changes to it. It takes time.</p><p>Conversely, deep down inside I feel this site&rsquo;s design is quite enough and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll make much changes to it in the near future. I made some contradiction but that&rsquo;s part of my personality. Please don&rsquo;t mind about it since I don&rsquo;t. One more important point is that you don&rsquo;t have the ability to comment on my post anymore. Literally, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary and to reduce the pressure I faced lately, it&rsquo;ll be more convience to eliminate that feature.</p><h3 id=the-kids-will-be-playing>The kids will be playing</h3><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nb>print</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=s2>&#34;Hello readers!&#34;</span><span class=p>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Of course, I can&rsquo;t set aside the joy purposes when writing something. Both maintaining the quality as well as quantity is infeasible, some slight unpredictable posts will be considered in this site. A plus point for this time site&rsquo;s updating is that I am allowed to add more pictures when writing. Mostly, it serves for metaphor and analogy but some can be used as entertainment and stimulate laughing moments. In essence, achieving the best performances means a mixture between strict and amusing. Make sure to stay chilled and relax when reading posts, or otherwise it&rsquo;ll upset you.</p><p>One last thing to proceed with caution, I&rsquo;m not foreigner and still I&rsquo;m learning this language so I don&rsquo;t think expecting the direct to point answering would be practical. I hope you keep an open mind about this guy and don&rsquo;t be nitpicking about my grammers since after all the message would be prioritized first.</p></div></div><div class=footer><div class=footer-social><span class="social-icon social-icon-medium"><a href=https://medium.com/@lemenio title=Medium target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/images/social/medium.svg width=24 height=24 alt=Medium></a></span>
