I used to believe that being authentic and truthful would be essential, but after some shocking events that taught me how to analysize and reflect my thoughts before showing them. Carefully saying things and avoid hurting people if possible, showing respect to them (a bit exaggeration here).
Ask yourself first, make sure you&amp;rsquo;re understanding the situation and aware of what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description></item></channel></rss>
