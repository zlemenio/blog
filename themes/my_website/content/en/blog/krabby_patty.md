We are born with natural capabilities to solve adversities, whether we come from crowded communities or chaotic, disadvantaged families. However, some of these adversities may not be acceptable to you. Here’s how the story begins.

People may choose different approaches to solve the problems life throws at us. They may accept and continue moving forward, or seek professional guidance. The latter is more related to our topic today.

It’s acceptable to seek guidance, but don’t rely too heavily on it. Remember that “it’s not in the stars to hold our destiny, but in ourselves.” Tarot readers may base their predictions on your thoughts or previous beliefs, but the future is not fixed yet. They show probabilities, not absolutes, and just because they reflect our minds doesn’t mean they are always true when searching for answers in an anxious way.

Astronomy, on the other hand, takes a wider view of your life’s path. It is based on the movement of the sun or celestial objects to explain aspects of a person’s personality and predict significant coincidences in their life.

Personally, I have experienced both types of predicting. Tarot predicted my future quite accurately — I had a mental breakdown and lost money. Astrology gave me a more accurate answer about my personality since I asked for it. But my curiosity led me to see my life’s potential, and I was shocked and quite depressed by it.

As a thinker, I overanalyzed their speech and applied their thoughts to my belief system, regardless of how accurate it was. Then I realized that I had changed quite a bit because a boring life motivated me to do so. Their interpretations were less accurate.

I chose to believe in them less but paid attention to things I hadn’t noticed, especially my bad habits and blind spot nature characteristics. Being aware of these things made me change myself faster.

There are two lessons here. First, don’t fully trust their thoughts or speech. Keep a skeptical mind and observe whether what they say is right. Don’t listen to them as if they’re your parents who have financial power to force you to develop in a certain way. If you’re an overthinker, it’s best to avoid these types of predictions.

If you’re an adventurous person and want to unfold your future by yourself, rather than seeing it than forgetting about it. If your friends made some suggestions, than you should think carefully before seeing a predictor.

Predictions can make you more ignorant or careless about your future. Relying too heavily on them may make you complacent in your actions, thinking that everything will work out as you expect.

Secondly, if you have already been exposed to it and have found the answer to your “life’s purpose,” there are two possible solutions. You can forget about it and continue living with the acceptance that they might be right. Live your life as if you haven’t heard anything from them and move on. The only way to get it out of your head is to prove it wrong.

You can do this by gaining life experience and acting against what they might say. By doing so, you have a chance to design a different life, proving them wrong and ultimately feeling happier.

In the end, you will be the one to decide your future, not the predictors. It is impossible to have a precise answer for how events will unfold, but remember to use them as sources for your decision-making.
